Okay, so these are the configuration files that I want everyone to use freely.

1. vimrc: It has a few handy customization. Completely documented.
2. xmonad.hs: Nothing special here, except the keybindings.
3. bashrc: my old bash configuration file. Don't use it now.
4. zshrc: zsh configured with oh-my-zsh. Pretty awesome!
5. mytheme.zsh-theme: This is the theme of my zsh prompt. I made it myself. Am really proud of it.
6. inputrc: Just added autocomplete. Nothing else
